# Complete Hobby Flow: Dashboard → tap daily hobby checkbox → verify completion
# Keys used: TestKeys.taskCheckbox(hobby.id) = 'hobby_checkbox_<id>'
#
# NOTE: hobby.id is a timestamp generated at creation time.
# This test uses regex 'hobby_checkbox_.*' to match the first available checkbox.
# Daily hobbies always appear in the list regardless of day, so the first match
# is expected to be a daily task. Requires hobbies to exist (run add_hobby flows first).
#
# The hobby is LEFT in the Completed state intentionally so that view_analytics.yml
# can verify that completed data is reflected in the analytics screen.
#
# Before running, ensure app is on the dashboard:
#   adb shell am start -n tham.hobbyist.app/.MainActivity

- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible:
      text: "In Progress"
    timeout: 5000

# Tap the checkbox for the first available daily hobby
- tapOn:
    id: "hobby_checkbox_.*"

# Wait for animated checkbox to complete
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify hobby moved to Completed section
- assertVisible:
    text: Completed
