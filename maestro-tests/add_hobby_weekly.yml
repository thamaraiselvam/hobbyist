# Add Hobby (Weekly, Change Day)
# Tests that a weekly hobby can be created with a specific weekday selected.
# Keys used: add_hobby_fab, hobby_name_input, weekly_frequency_button,
#            color_palette_button_5, create_hobby_button
#
# NOTE: Weekday circle buttons ('M','T','W','T','F','S','S') use Key() only —
# no Semantics(identifier:) — so they are not addressable by id in the Android
# accessibility tree. They are tapped by visible text instead.
# 'W' (Wednesday, index 2) is the only unique letter among the 7 day labels.
# Other unique letters: 'F' (Friday). Ambiguous: 'M', 'T', 'S'.
#
# Before running:
#   adb shell am start -n tham.hobbyist.app/.MainActivity
# Onboarding must be complete (run onboarding.yml first).
