# 🔐 Your SHA-1 Certificate Fingerprint

## Copy this SHA-1 and add it to Firebase Console:

SHA-1: 46:9E:B5:ED:AB:9E:CB:22:56:04:E3:D8:D3:88:E4:2E:82:38:B6:4E

## Also add SHA-256 (recommended):

SHA-256: 56:81:E4:06:2E:35:F0:D7:79:EE:96:C5:A7:5F:34:86:48:52:3E:E4:1F:CF:C4:3D:2A:47:28:61:D6:AA:78:9B

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- This SHA-1 is from your DEBUG keystore
- It's stored at: ~/.android/debug.keystore
- You can ALWAYS regenerate this fingerprint using the keytool command
- For production apps, you'll create a RELEASE keystore with a different SHA-1

## 💾 Do You Need to Save This?

**NO!** You don't need to save this file. 

Why? Because:
- The keystore file (~/.android/debug.keystore) already exists on your computer
- You can always get the SHA-1 again using: 
  `keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android`

However, you SHOULD backup your RELEASE keystore (for production) when you create one!
